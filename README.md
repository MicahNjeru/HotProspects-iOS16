#  Hot Prospects iOS 16
## About this app
- This app helps users track people they meet at conferences
- It will show a QR code that stores the user's attendance information
- Other users of `Hot Prospects` can then use their app to scan other users' QR codes and add them to their list of later follow-ups

## What I've learnt
How to:
1. Add `TabViews` and "tag" them using `enums` for use in switching between views
2. Filter items from an array using `switch cases`
3. Generate a `QR Code` from given text strings
